Generate Scratch Card PINs:
You'll need to generate unique scratch card PINs for each student. These PINs should be securely stored in the database.

Store the PINs:
Store the scratch card PINs in the database and associate them with each student. The PIN should be stored in a hashed form for security.

Allow Students to Enter the PIN:
Create a form where students can enter their scratch card PIN.

Verify the PIN:
Once the student enters the PIN, you will check if it matches the stored PIN for that student. If it matches, grant access to their report.

Invalidate the PIN after Use:
After the student successfully enters their PIN and views their report, mark the PIN as used or delete it so it cannot be reused.
